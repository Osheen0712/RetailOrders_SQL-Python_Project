# RetailOrders_SQL-Python_Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze retail order data to gain insights into various aspects such as total orders, revenue, best-selling products, and sales trends. The project uses Python for data processing and SQL for querying the database.

## Project Structure
 - Jupyter Notebook: RETAIL_ORDERS.ipynb
 - SQL Script: RETAIL_ORDERS.sql


## Files
  # RETAIL_ORDERS.ipynb
The Jupyter Notebook provides a detailed analysis using Python. The key steps include:

 - Loading Libraries: Importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
 - Loading Dataset: Reading the dataset from a CSV file.
 - Handling Null Values: Managing missing data.
 - Transformation : Transforming the dataset means adding and dropping columns and changing datatypes of columns as required.
 - Connecting to SQL Database: Using SQLAlchemy to run SQL queries from the notebook.

 # RETAIL_ORDERS.sql
This SQL script includes queries to perform exploratory data analysis on the retail orders dataset. The main queries are:

 - Total Orders: Calculate the total number of orders.
 - Total Revenue: Calculate the total revenue generated from all orders.
 - Top 5 Best-Selling Products: Identify the top 5 best-selling products by quantity.
 - Revenue by Region: Calculate the total revenue generated by each region.
 - Top 10 Highest Revenue Products: Identify the top 10 products generating the highest revenue.
 - Top 5 Products by Region: Identify the top 5 highest selling products in each region.
 - Month-over-Month Growth: Compare month-over-month sales growth for 2022 and 2023.
 - Highest Sales by Category: Identify the month with the highest sales for each category.


## Getting Started
  # Prerequisites
  - SQL Server or any SQL-compliant database
  - Python 3.x
  - Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sqlalchemy (for database connection)

## Analyze Data:
- Open the Jupyter Notebook to execute Python code for data analysis .
- Then open the RETAIL_ORDERS.sql file in your SQL client and run the queries to generate the desired insights.
